# Enhanced PINO Paper: Balancing Data Fitting and Physical Properties - A Comparative Study on Physics Loss Coefficients and Fourier Analysis Techniques in PINO Models for PDEs with Enhanced Training Framework

## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive study on Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), specifically focusing on the 2D heat equation. We investigate the critical balance between data fitting and physical properties through systematic analysis of physics loss coefficients and Fourier analysis techniques. Our original contribution demonstrates the significant impact of physics loss coefficient selection on PINO performance, achieving R² scores up to 0.8590 with optimal configurations. Building upon these findings, we introduce an enhanced training framework incorporating advanced techniques such as learning rate scheduling, early stopping, mixed precision training, and gradient clipping. The enhanced framework achieves superior performance with R² scores up to 0.8802, representing a 2.5% improvement over baseline methods while reducing training time by 20-50% through early stopping. Our comprehensive experimental validation across 6 enhanced configurations demonstrates the robustness and practical applicability of the proposed approach, providing clear guidelines for PINO implementation in real-world applications.

## 1. Introduction

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their extension, Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs), have emerged as powerful tools for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical laws directly into neural network architectures. While PINNs operate on point-wise data, PINOs learn mappings between function spaces, making them particularly suitable for parametric PDE problems and real-time applications.

The success of PINO models critically depends on the balance between data fitting accuracy and physical constraint satisfaction. This balance is typically controlled through physics loss coefficients, which weight the contribution of physical laws in the overall loss function. However, the optimal selection of these coefficients and their impact on model performance remains an open research question.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Physics-Informed Neural Networks

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) were introduced by Raissi et al. [1] as a framework for solving PDEs by incorporating physical laws directly into neural network loss functions. PINNs have been successfully applied to various PDE types including heat equations, wave equations, and Navier-Stokes equations [2, 3].

### 2.2 Physics-Informed Neural Operators

PINOs extend PINNs by learning mappings between function spaces rather than point-wise solutions [4, 5]. This approach enables faster inference and better generalization for parametric PDE problems. The Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) [6] and its physics-informed variants have shown particular promise for scientific computing applications.

### 2.3 Training Optimization for Physics-Informed Models

Recent work has focused on improving training stability and efficiency for physics-informed models. Techniques such as curriculum learning [7], adaptive loss weighting [8], and advanced optimizers [9] have been shown to improve convergence and final performance.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 PINO Architecture

Our PINO architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Fourier Transform Layer**: Converts spatial domain inputs to frequency domain
2. **Neural Operator Layer**: Learns the mapping between function spaces using fully connected layers with GELU activation
3. **Inverse Fourier Transform Layer**: Converts frequency domain outputs back to spatial domain

The architecture is designed to handle 2D heat equation problems with varying boundary conditions and initial conditions.

### 3.2 Physics-Informed Loss Function

The total loss function combines data fitting loss and physics-informed loss:

```
L_total = L_data + α * L_physics
```

where:
- L_data is the mean squared error between predicted and actual solutions
- L_physics is the physics constraint loss based on the heat equation
- α is the physics loss coefficient that balances the two terms
