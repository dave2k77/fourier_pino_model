## üìù **Abstract Enhancement**

### **Original Abstract:**
"This paper presents a comprehensive study on Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), specifically focusing on the 2D heat equation. We investigate the critical balance between data fitting and physical properties through systematic analysis of physics loss coefficients and Fourier analysis techniques. Our original contribution demonstrates the significant impact of physics loss coefficient selection on PINO performance, achieving R¬≤ scores up to 0.8590 with optimal configurations. Building upon these findings, we introduce an enhanced training framework incorporating advanced techniques such as learning rate scheduling, early stopping, mixed precision training, and gradient clipping. The enhanced framework achieves superior performance with R¬≤ scores up to 0.8802, representing a 2.5% improvement over baseline methods while reducing training time by 20-50% through early stopping. Our comprehensive experimental validation across 6 enhanced configurations demonstrates the robustness and practical applicability of the proposed approach, providing clear guidelines for PINO implementation in real-world applications."

### **Enhanced Abstract:**
"This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), with particular emphasis on the 2D heat equation. We systematically analyze the critical balance between data fitting accuracy and physical constraint satisfaction through rigorous examination of physics loss coefficients and Fourier analysis techniques. Our primary contribution establishes the fundamental importance of physics loss coefficient selection in PINO performance, achieving R¬≤ scores up to 0.8590 with optimally configured parameters. Building upon these foundational insights, we introduce a novel enhanced training framework that incorporates state-of-the-art techniques including adaptive learning rate scheduling, intelligent early stopping, mixed precision training, and gradient clipping mechanisms. The enhanced framework demonstrates superior performance with R¬≤ scores reaching 0.8802, representing a 2.5% improvement over baseline methods while achieving 20-50% training time reduction through strategic early stopping.

## üî¨ **Introduction Section Enhancement**

### **6.1.1 Enhanced Introduction Paragraphs**

**Original:**
"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their extension, Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs), have emerged as powerful tools for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical laws directly into neural network architectures. While PINNs operate on point-wise data, PINOs learn mappings between function spaces, making them particularly suitable for parametric PDE problems and real-time applications."

**Enhanced:**
"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their sophisticated extension, Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs), have emerged as transformative computational tools for solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by seamlessly integrating fundamental physical laws directly into neural network architectures. While PINNs operate on discrete point-wise data, PINOs represent a paradigm shift by learning continuous mappings between function spaces, rendering them particularly well-suited for parametric PDE problems, real-time applications, and scenarios requiring rapid inference across multiple parameter configurations."

**Original:**
"The success of PINO models critically depends on the balance between data fitting accuracy and physical constraint satisfaction. This balance is typically controlled through physics loss coefficients, which weight the contribution of physical laws in the overall loss function. However, the optimal selection of these coefficients and their impact on model performance remains an open research question."

**Enhanced:**
"The success of PINO models fundamentally hinges on achieving an optimal balance between data fitting accuracy and physical constraint satisfaction‚Äîa critical trade-off that determines both model performance and physical validity. This balance is systematically controlled through physics loss coefficients, which precisely weight the contribution of physical laws within the composite loss function. Despite their critical importance, the principled selection of these coefficients and their comprehensive impact on model performance, convergence behavior, and generalization capabilities remains an open research question with significant implications for practical deployment."
