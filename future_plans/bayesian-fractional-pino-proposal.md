# Bayesian Physics-Informed Fractional Operator Learning for Complex ODEs and PDEs

## Executive Summary

This research proposal outlines a comprehensive extension of Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) by integrating **Bayesian uncertainty quantification** and **fractional calculus** to create a novel framework for solving complex differential equations. Building upon the foundational work in PINO development, this project aims to bridge three critical gaps in current scientific machine learning:

1. **Uncertainty quantification** in physics-informed neural operator learning
2. **Memory effects and long-range dependencies** through fractional calculus
3. **Complex boundary conditions** in real-world applications

## Research Motivation

### Current State and Limitations

Your previous work on PINOs with Fourier Neural Operators demonstrated excellent performance on the 2D heat equation, achieving 97% accuracy with optimized physics loss coefficients. However, several limitations remain:

- **No uncertainty quantification**: Current deterministic approaches provide point estimates without confidence intervals
- **Integer-order derivatives only**: Cannot capture memory effects or anomalous diffusion
- **Simple boundary conditions**: Limited to standard Dirichlet/Neumann conditions
- **Single-task learning**: Each problem requires retraining from scratch

### Scientific Opportunity

Recent advances in 2024-2025 have opened new possibilities:

- **Bayesian Neural Operators** (NEON, 2024) enable uncertainty quantification in operator learning
- **Fractional Physics-Informed Neural Networks** (fPINNs) successfully handle memory effects
- **Meta-learning for PINNs** accelerates training across similar problems
- **Variational inference techniques** provide scalable Bayesian inference

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Bayesian PINO Foundation (Months 1-6)

#### 1.1 Bayesian Neural Operator Framework
Extend your existing PINO architecture with uncertainty quantification:

```python
class BayesianPINO(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, layers, modes, width):
        super().__init__()
        self.fourier_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            BayesianFourierLayer(width, modes) for _ in range(layers)
        ])
        self.uncertainty_head = UncertaintyHead(width)
    
    def forward(self, x, return_uncertainty=True):
        # Standard forward pass with uncertainty estimation
        mu, sigma = self.predict_with_uncertainty(x)
        return mu, sigma if return_uncertainty else mu
```

#### 1.2 Variational Inference Integration
Implement three Bayesian training approaches:

1. **Variational Inference (VI)**: Fast, scalable, suitable for large datasets
2. **Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)**: Particle-based, captures complex posteriors
3. **Deep Ensembles**: Simple to implement, provides good uncertainty estimates

#### 1.3 Enhanced Loss Function
Modify your physics loss to include uncertainty:

```python
def bayesian_physics_loss(u_pred, u_true, physics_residual, uncertainty):
    data_loss = gaussian_nll_loss(u_pred, u_true, uncertainty)
    physics_loss = weighted_physics_residual(physics_residual, uncertainty)
    return data_loss + λ * physics_loss
```

### Phase 2: Meta-Learning and Transfer Learning (Months 4-9)

#### 2.1 Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
Implement MAML for PINOs to enable rapid adaptation:

```python
class MetaPINO(BayesianPINO):
    def meta_update(self, support_tasks, query_tasks):
        # Learn to learn across different PDE parameters
        meta_gradients = self.compute_meta_gradients(support_tasks)
        self.adapt_to_query(query_tasks, meta_gradients)
```

#### 2.2 Transfer Learning Framework
Develop strategies for transferring knowledge between:
- Different PDE types (heat → wave → diffusion)
- Different geometries (2D → 3D)
- Different boundary conditions

### Phase 3: Fractional Calculus Integration (Months 7-15)

#### 3.1 Fractional Derivatives Implementation
Integrate Caputo fractional derivatives into the physics loss:

```python
def fractional_derivative(u, x, alpha):
    """
    Compute Caputo fractional derivative of order alpha
    using Grünwald-Letnikov discretization
    """
    if alpha == 1.0:
        return torch.autograd.grad(u, x, create_graph=True)[0]
    else:
        return caputo_derivative_gl(u, x, alpha)
```

#### 3.2 Memory-Enhanced Neural Operators
Design neural operators that can handle:
- **Anomalous diffusion**: $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D_\alpha \nabla^2 u$
- **Viscoelastic materials**: $\tau^\alpha \frac{\partial^\alpha \sigma}{\partial t^\alpha} + \sigma = G \gamma$
- **Financial models**: Fractional Black-Scholes equations

#### 3.3 Non-Local Operator Learning
Develop operators for non-local effects:

```python
class FractionalNeuralOperator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, alpha_learnable=True):
        super().__init__()
        self.alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(0.8)) if alpha_learnable else 0.8
        self.memory_kernel = MemoryKernel(self.alpha)
    
    def forward(self, u):
        # Apply fractional operator with learned memory effects
        return self.memory_kernel(u, self.alpha)
```

### Phase 4: Complex Boundary Conditions (Months 10-18)

#### 4.1 Adaptive Boundary Handling
Implement neural boundary conditions that can learn:
- **Moving boundaries**: $\Gamma(t) = \{x : \phi(x,t) = 0\}$
- **Contact problems**: Variational inequalities
- **Free boundary problems**: Stefan problems, obstacle problems

#### 4.2 Multi-Physics Coupling
Handle coupled systems:
- Fluid-structure interaction
- Electromagnetics-thermal coupling
- Chemical reaction-diffusion

### Phase 5: EEG and Neuroscience Applications (Months 12-24)

#### 4.1 Brain Dynamics Modeling
Apply fractional operators to model:
- **Memory effects in neural activity**: Long-range temporal correlations
- **Anomalous diffusion in brain tissue**: Non-Gaussian spreading patterns
- **Scale-free neural oscillations**: Power-law behaviors in EEG

#### 4.2 EEG Source Localization
Develop physics-informed models for:

```python
class FractionalBrainModel(BayesianPINO):
    def __init__(self, fractional_order=0.8):
        super().__init__()
        self.alpha = fractional_order
        self.diffusion_tensor = LearnableAnisotropicDiffusion()
    
    def forward_model(self, sources):
        # Solve fractional diffusion for EEG forward problem
        return self.solve_fractional_pde(sources, self.alpha)
```

## Methodological Innovations

### 1. Hybrid Automatic Differentiation-Discretization
Combine automatic differentiation for integer orders with numerical discretization for fractional orders:

```python
def hybrid_derivative(u, x, order):
    if order == int(order):
        return auto_diff_derivative(u, x, int(order))
    else:
        return fractional_discretization(u, x, order)
```

### 2. Adaptive Physics Loss Weighting
Learn optimal physics loss coefficients automatically:

```python
class AdaptivePhysicsLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_loss_terms):
        super().__init__()
        self.log_sigma = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_loss_terms))
    
    def forward(self, losses):
        weights = torch.exp(-self.log_sigma)
        return torch.sum(weights * losses + 0.5 * self.log_sigma)
```

### 3. Multi-Fidelity Learning
Incorporate multiple levels of model fidelity:
- High-fidelity: Full fractional PDEs
- Medium-fidelity: Approximated fractional models
- Low-fidelity: Integer-order approximations
